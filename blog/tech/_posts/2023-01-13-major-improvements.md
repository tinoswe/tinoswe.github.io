Today I’ve managed to do many things. This is all going unexpectedly fast. Here’s what I have done.

1. I terminated the unstyled first implementation of my blog by defining a release on GitHub
2. I created a new branch dedicated to styling. I quickly decided to start using Bootstrap 5, which I love.
3. I checked out the new branch and started to develop locally on VS Code using Ruby gems. Or at least I have set up the mechanism.
4. I easily integrated Bootstrap 5 with some icons and redefined header. Footer is pushed to the bottom of the page as expected.
5. I pushed everything back on GitHub.

## Future steps

Next things to do:

* investigate GitHub actions to be able to blog from Google Docs (yes! GitHub is great for automating things). This would bring me to one of my goals which was to blog from my cell phone easily.
* Style single posts
* Style homepage
* Add a contact form and make it work using some free third party tool

All for today.
